# Changelog

All notable changes to this crate are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the crate adheres
to [SemVer](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added — clean-room rebuild round 1 (2026-05-20)

- Annex B byte-stream walker: `NalIter`, `collect_nal_units`,
  supporting both 3-byte (`00 00 01`) and 4-byte (`00 00 00 01`)
  start codes.
- §7.3.1.2 NAL header parse: `NalHeader` exposes
  `nal_unit_type`, `nuh_layer_id`, and `TemporalId` (derived from
  `nuh_temporal_id_plus1`); `forbidden_zero_bit` set and
  zero-`nuh_temporal_id_plus1` are surfaced as `NalError`.
- §7.4.1.1 emulation-prevention strip
  (`strip_emulation_prevention`) — `0x00 0x00 0x03` decodes to
  `0x00 0x00`.
- 7 unit tests covering: 3-byte start code single NAL, 4-byte
  start code with two NAL units, emulation-prevention round-trip,
  forbidden-bit rejection, zero-temporal-id rejection, no
  start-code-at-all rejection, and header field-packing round
  trip (incl. non-zero `nuh_layer_id`).

### Erased

- Prior master history was force-erased on **2026-05-18** under
  Hat-3 cold enforcement of the workspace clean-room policy
  (`docs/IMPLEMENTOR_ROUND.md`).

### Reset

- Crate reduced to a minimal `oxideav_core::register!` stub. Every
  public API returns `Error::NotImplemented`. The crates.io version
  (`0.0.8`) is preserved on the new master to avoid breaking
  downstream version pins; the published versions on crates.io will
  be yanked by the maintainer.
- HEIF/HEIC `heif` cargo feature is dropped from the scaffold
  (re-introduced in a future rebuild round once the decoder core is
  back).

### Next

- VPS/SPS/PPS semantic parse (§7.3.2.x). RBSP-stop-bit handling.
- Slice header parse.
- CABAC remains blocked on docs #444 (`cu_qp_delta` +
  `last_sig_coeff` multi-QG / multi-CTU 4:2:2 trace gap).
