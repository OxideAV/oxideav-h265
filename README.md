# oxideav-h265

A pure-Rust H.265 / HEVC video codec for the
[oxideav](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav) framework.

## Status

**Orphan-rebuild scaffold (2026-05-18).** The prior implementation was
retired under the workspace
[clean-room policy](https://github.com/OxideAV/oxideav/blob/master/docs/IMPLEMENTOR_ROUND.md):
a CTU-level source comment cited a specific named variable and line
number in an external library's HEVC decoder — clean-room provenance
for the surrounding code path could not be defended. Master history
was fully erased per the Hat-3 cold-enforcement procedure.

The implementation will be re-built against the published H.265
specification (ITU-T Recommendation H.265 | ISO/IEC 23008-2) in a
future clean-room round.
